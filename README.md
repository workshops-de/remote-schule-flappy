# Clumsy Bird example code to teach people basic of coding

In this basic example we going to show people the basics of coding with a game called Clumsy Bird.

It's based and forked from [this version](http://ellisonleao.github.io/clumsy-bird/). Thanks [Ellison Le√£o](https://github.com/ellisonleao) for providing this.

We're not going to create the game the same way or so detailed like in the orginal version. It's more like a basic direction.

## How to do it!? :) 

First of all you should create a new folder on your computer to put some files that are related to this project.
You need a Browser, a IDE and a webserver to run this example.

### The Browser
You can use any browser of your choice for example Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge.

### The IDE
IDE: integrated development environment

A IDE is basically a texteditor specialized for the task of development.
You can find some special configuration and toolings here that make your life easier in developing programs.

We for ourself using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - it's free.

### The WebServer

You need a basic webserver of your choice. 
If you don't know what that is and waht to do we recommend the basic `http-server` from NodeJS.
To install this you need to run the following steps.

1) Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
2) Open your project folder with Visual Studio Code
3) Open a new Terminal via the menu "new Terminal"
4) Type in the following command that will run the http-server `npx http-server`
5) Click the message or open your browser `http://127.0.0.1:8080`

You now have a local website you could run.
Without any files you'll just see something like "Index of". That is correct for now. We going to fix this in the next steps! =)


Happy coding & learning!
